Description
-----------

For whatever reason, your CTO thinks you should be promoted to lead developer. Or worse, your CEO thinks you should be promoted to CTO.

Impostor syndrome kicks in. You were perfectly happy coding all day in your little corner! You don't know how to lead a team or make informed technological decisions!

But, alas, someone up there thought you could. **What were they thinking?!**

This talk will be a small helper guide for the green lead developer, CTO or developer who wants to start honing their skills for the next step. Experienced lead developers and CTOs are welcomed to chime in.

It's a collection of little more than a dozen points collected by personal experience, someone else's advice, and a lot of reading, that you should keep in mind to avoid getting overwhelmed. From people management to handling technical decisions, especially when they're wrong.
